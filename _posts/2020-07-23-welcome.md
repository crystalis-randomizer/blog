Welcome to the Crystalis Randomizer blog. This is a forum for the
developers to discuss details of the history and development of
the randomizer.

We have a number of stories planned for the next few months, and
hope readers will enjoy getting an inside glimpse into what goes
into creating this kind of randomizer.
